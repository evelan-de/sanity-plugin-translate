# Sanity Plugin Translate

This Sanity plugin leverages the DeepL API to provide translation capabilities within Sanity Studio. It is designed to enhance content management systems by allowing automatic translation of text fields and document references based on specified languages.

## Features

- **Translation Integration**: Utilizes the `deepl-node` library to integrate with the DeepL API for robust translation capabilities.
- **Document Actions**: Includes actions for translating documents and fixing references within the Sanity Studio.
- **Configurable**: Supports configuration for different environments with customizable plugin options.

## Installation

1. Install the plugin via npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install sanity-plugin-translate
   # or
   yarn add sanity-plugin-translate
   ```

2. Include the plugin in your Sanity Studio's configuration.

## Configuration

To configure the plugin, you need to specify the DeepL API key and other optional settings in your Sanity Studio configuration file:

```
   import { TranslationPlugin } from 'sanity-plugin-translate';

   export default createConfig({
      // Your existing Sanity configuration
      ...,
      plugins: [
         TranslationPlugin({
            BASE_URL: 'https://api.deepl.com',
            deeplApiKey: 'your-deepl-api-key'
            includeFixReferenceAction: boolean,
            includeTranslateAction: boolean,
         })
      ]
   });
```

## Usage

After installation, the translation actions can be triggered from the document actions dropdown in the Sanity Studio. Ensure you have the necessary API keys and configurations set up as described in the plugin documentation.

### Translating a Document

You can translate documents by selecting the "Translate Document" action from the document action dropdown. This action uses the DeepL API to translate the text fields of the document to the specified language.

### Fixing References

The "Fix Language References" action helps in adjusting document references to point to the translated versions of linked documents.

## Develop & Test
